  - Not announced yet
- [x] (DPC) Google Summer of Code 2024
    - Advice from NumFOCUS for 2024:
      > A key lesson learnt from last year is that Google‚Äôs approach to selecting projects is not well suited to umbrella organizations like NumFOCUS. This year, we heavily recommend projects which can apply on their own to do so.
      > We encourage you to explore and propose projects in the AI/ML space. We also expect more potential GSoC contributors to be looking for AI/ML related ideas.
    - From Google
      > We are looking forward to having more AI/ML open source organizations involved in GSoC 2024
    - Is there interest in a conda-forge for GSOC 2024?
