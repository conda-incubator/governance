## New Agenda Items

- [x] (CHL) PyCon 2024 and other conferences; anyone attending?
    - Anaconda might have some presence at PyCon US
    - Some Anconda/conda folks helping to organizing PyCon US packaging summit
    - WV at PyCon US (talk), PyCon DE, SciPY US
- [X] (TH) New plugin settings hook planned for hopefully being released in 24.03.x
    - Allows plugin authors to define their own settings
    - These plugins will be accessible under `plugins.*` in config files
    - Settings will be accessible under `CONDA_PLUGINS_*` in environment variables
    - More information in the PR: https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/13554
-  [x] (JRG) [CEP-15](https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/blob/main/cep-15.md) and base_urls
    - Want to use this for ecosystems like Napari, Spyder
    - Implementation? I see this as the resurrection of "static metachannels" :)  :japanese_goblin:
    - [conda/conda#13137](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/13137) still open
- [ ] (WV) New CEPs? 
  - [ ] Thinking of extras and optional dependencies.
    - https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/pull/55
    - Looking at PyPI, but also other ecosystems (Recommends/Suggests in deb)
    - Where to store the extras info:
      - Markers in `depends`? Could also enable win-only dependencies on noarch.
      - New field `extras={extras-name: [packages]}`
  - [ ] Tried JLAP, but thinking sharded repodata would be more performant.
    - Can be fetched in parallel, and caches more easily.
    - MB: Suggests using a small index file with the mapping, so sharding doesn't get too fine grained.
  - More recipe CEPs: cache, Jinja, tests, how the rendered recipe looks like
  - (CHL) Re-start work on microarchitecture/CPU-features dependent builds
    - https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/issues/59
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/24306
